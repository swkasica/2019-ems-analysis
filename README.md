# 2019-ems-analysis

Analysis of on-time rates for priority one emergency calls with Austin-Travis County EMS call data. The data source is `priority1calls.csv`, a subset of all EMS calls 2013-2017 that was provided in response to a records request. The subset is the original database filtered to contain only priority-one calls with a valid `Incident_Response_Interval_Goal`.

`analysis.ipynb` uses `priority1calls.csv` to analyze on-time rates by emergency services district.

`map_grid.ipynb` uses `grid_1mile.json`, a hexagon grid generated by the [City of Austin grid creator](https://cityofaustin.github.io/geojson-grid/), to bin and map on-time rates by one-mile grids.
